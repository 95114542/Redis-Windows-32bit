# Redis-Windows-32bit
The Windows 32-bit bin files for Redis can download here.
Some times we have to deploy our application on OLD Windows 32-bit OS. Just because the MSOpenTech(https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis) only support 64-bit version, we have to compile our ourself. Now you can SAVE your time download here.
